# Dynamic Dummy Image Generator — as seen on DummyImage.com

**This script enables you to create placeholder images in a breeze.**

## Usage

This script handles the following parameters, where basically all of them are optional.

* `size` — Examples:<br>500x250 (= 500px width, 250px height)<br>500 (= 500px width, 500px height)
* `type` — Examples:<br>png (= PNG image)<br>gif (= GIF image)<br>jpeg or jpg (= JPEG image)
* `bg` — Examples:<br>f00 (= #FF0000 as background color)<br>FF0855 (= #FF0855 as background color)
* `color` — Examples:<br>000 (= #000000 as font color)<br>FFFFFF (= #FFFFFF as font color)
* `text` — Examples:<br>Lore Ipsum (= Image has Lore Ipsum written on it)

### Credits
Original idea by [Russel Heimlich](https://github.com/kingkool68/). When I first published this script, [DummyImage.com](https://dummyimage.com/) was not Open Source, so I had to write a small script to replace the function on my own server.
